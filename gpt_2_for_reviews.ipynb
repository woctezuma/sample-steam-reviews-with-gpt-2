I am truly impressed with the quality and thoughtfulness of the design.

The game is well designed and it seems as though the devs put a lot of thought into the game and actively encourage players to play their game. There is a detailed ranking system, well done leaderboards and very slick advertisements. The game is however not without its flaws.

The game really isn't, it's designed so that you can't help but feel you are participating in something big. RNG can be a powerful thing, but it can also be a hinderance, you have to be able to cope with the possibility of RNG wherever it may be. The game really shines in the situation of having a plan B, BFF, or even an ally. The risk is still too high for me to recommend.\n",

If you're a hardcore board game player and have spent any time getting into this genre, this should be in your library. It's a well designed game with fun mechanics, but it's not without its flaws. I didn't feel it was \"perfect\" and it certainly wasn't my cup of tea, but I ended up returning it because it was sooooo frustrating. It didn't feel like a \"perfect\" game, but I gave it a pass. Perhaps it was because I was playing in the coop, but I think you need the players to \"accidentally\" meet in the lobby when you're the last one standing. There's no way in hell I'm ever going to be the last one standing in a game like this. Sometimes you've just got to \"accidentally\" get back up and go.\n",

            "One of the best parts of the game has to be the customization.  You can get tattoos, makeup, and pretty much anything else you want.  All the cards give you stat bonuses or exactitude bonuses as well as some negative effects.  Basically anything can happen and it's up to you to figure out why.  Basically every card is a dice to be played and you are going to need to learn to accept these as part of the game.  Once you do, the customization feels quite nice.\n",
            "There are single-player and multiplayer modes, ranked and non-ranked.  Single-player has a few things going for it, such as the ability to play the cards in any order and change any one card on the board to suit your liking.  Non-ranked has a few things going against it, such as being relatively new to the game (newer than me).  Also keep in mind that playing multiplayer online against other people can get a bit intense.  As a result I don't think there is a realistic opportunity for competitive gaming here other than the server-side options.\n",
            "Along with this comes a nice range of accessibility features, such as emoticons, which are handy for quieter games.  Unfortunately most of these are located in the multiplayer interface, so you are unable to easily type your comments or post gameplay videos.  This is unfortunate as it makes the game more tailor made to be enjoyed with players with disabilities.\n",

            "You can find me on Steam playing most of my games alongside a few other gamers, usually around lvl-15 or so.  It's rarely the case where I'm winning but when I do it's pretty fun to be sure my skillset matches what I have.\n",
            "Currently I'm pretty hooked on this game; only major complaint is that the game is way too long; it's something I'd like to have included into a normal game, but since I play this way, it's something I want to have included as well.  Normally I'm happy with shorter games, but this one is getting long enough that it's dragging out my match.\n",
            "Besides that, I really recommend this game.  The mechanics are clever and the overall enjoyment is great.  I don't feel I'm winning every time, but I keep trying and hoping.  It's a clever game with well thought out mechanics.  Hopefully someone manages to get a retail version sometime.\n",
            "Probably my biggest gripe is that the game is way too reliant on luck.  Other games I play rely on luck a lot more--like, I lose a game during the season just to be on the safe side and move on to the next one.

            "Well, first of all, he is my opponent during the match. I hope that he knows that I am looking for a revenge and that I will repay him for all the grief he has caused me. Apart from that, I have no interest in winning this game. I am solely interested in securing the most points and winning the game within the shortest amount of time. As it stands, the game is long and boring. If this was a real game, I would probably choose a different opponent because, well, one opponent can take you out in an instant.\n",
            "The gameplay itself is fairly standard for board games. You have six cards - each card has a dice number on it, which determines how many places on the board the player can move (as soon as cards are used, they are replaced by new cards, so you always have six cards at hand). Cards have both an effect that can only be activated on certain types of spaces, and a picture of a dice. That picture is how many places you can go - you can use a card to move to any spot on the board.\n",
            "The six cards are used to activate various rules of the game. The picture is pretty, but limited, and you can use a card to activate a rule of the game only when you drew the picture. For example, if you want to activate the \"Go To Jail\", you need to go to the \"Investigate\" spot on the board. Once you there, you can use the money you get to pay for the \"Go To Jail\" spot, and if you use the \"Investigate\" spot, you need to pay a cop to investigate you. The game itself is fairly standard fare - lots of dice rolls, lots of cards, and most of it bad news.\n",
            "One of the biggest learning curves in this game is learning how to navigate the town both smartly and efficiently. You will need to do this while juggling your studies, which can get pretty tough if you are not careful. The game itself is organized into several play spaces, each with a different feel. You can use a card to move to the specific space, then use a card to move across the board to the next space, or even play a card to move across the board at high speed (see below for an example of how to play a card at a certain spot).\n",
            "The game itself is divided into several parts - the tutorial, the multiplayer lobby, and the multiplayer match itself. During the tutorial, you will learn how to properly use a card, then progress to the next part of the tutorial, where you learn how to properly use a different card, and so on. During the multiplayer lobby, you will need to play matches to get the experience\n",

            "<|startoftext|>I hate board games. So if you do not like that type of game, this should be it. Great strategic play out of 3 cards. Nothing like seeing your plan worked out and your enemy's making the same mistake twice is exciting and challenging. At the same time, the gameplay is still fairly new, and it is refreshing to play against the AI. It is also still a bit buggy (even with the latest patch), and I've had some fun with it, but against the AI it's just too random. If you like this type of game, definitely get it. It is a good game, and you should buy it.\n"
