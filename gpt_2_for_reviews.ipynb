It's still my favourite Paradox title and I would say it's the deepest and most enjoyable grand strategy.  I am still trying to understand the complex mechanics of the game and what it's trying to teach you.  I would never want it to teach you how to just have fun.

The difficulty ramp is a joy to watch, however it also seems like the developers aren't too fond of balancing large games such as this by making them easy in order to create a more diverse player base. For me, the game's difficulty was its downfall, especially at times as your dynasty struggles through a myriad of small squabbles, and the other options seem to have more depth and variety; some is in the game, some is not, but Paradox's formula of making a game so complex that it feels like a challenge while still maintaining a challenge in the gameplay is great.<|endoftext|>\n",

The UI is super confusing, but you can start from the bottom up with little to no problems in the future.<|endoftext|>\n",
            "<|startoftext|>I've got over 100 hours into this game and I can't say I'm a fan of it, but it is fun.  You really have to think of what you want to do, and not just what you want to attack, in a game of this magnitude, you want to be the greatest pirate of all time?  What about the great Mongolians who are on the opposite side of the map from you?  When it comes to tactics, you need a bit of imagination.  If your strategy style is like mine, just focus on the large units.  When you can focus on large armies you will know exactly what you are doing.  I've got over 1000 hours on this game and it's still confusing me, because I'm not familiar with all of the mechanics in the game.  The combat is the other small problem the game has.  It's not the battles, like your infantry, that are so frustrating, they simply aren't as important as I'm making out.  My point is that I'm still learning about how the game works, and there is so much more that still needs to be considered.  Things might be too basic to understand by some people, but there are so many more complexities that go into making a game so complicated.  I wish I'd played this before, because now I can see ways that don't look immediately obvious to the player.  There is no game where you have to constantly look at your tiny army and call them to arms, because then they might start to lose steam.  It's not a game where that happens very often, but if you keep playing you might lose your precious land.  It's not a game where you can just call your armies into service and move them around, it's not a game that needs to stop there, because clearly that's what the player wants.  It's a game that rewards you for doing that, and rewards you for waiting for things to happen.  This is a game where it's good to be the king, especially if you are the king's grandson or great grandson.  So, keep your grandson in the loop, and don't give him the title, don't give him his own counties.  You might be tempted to plot against a friend or a family member, but that might backfire on you, since you might start a faction to take back the crown, and then the king or emperor calls on you to start a war against your friends and family members.  It's all about the long-term health of the crown.  So stay away from that.  I have had games where I plotted against members of my own families, because they refused to fall in line with my wishes, and then gained some of those family memberships themselves.  I've had games where I plotted against people outside my own realm, because they'd been allies with me for generations.\n",
            "So, yes, I'm a fan of this game.   I'm a fanatic of waiting for things to happen, and when I'm going full steam ahead with something I've set my target, it usually works out in my favor.  There's a reason a game does have a tendency to stall out once you're in a situation where things don't go your way.  Even the best games in history have a way of doing that.  So while I don't dislike paradox's games, I do dislike the way they handle persistent problems that simply don't require intervention.  So if you want your game to work properly, please get an older, more stable game with less bugs, and more stable developers, and steer clear of Crusader Kings II.<|endoftext|>\n",
            "<|startoftext|>Crusader Kings is one of those games which you pick up and play for a bit, then realise you aren't playing the whole game, and are instead playing less of it.

If you enjoy the base game, then grab the DLC. If you play it differently, then grab a few of the DLC, and then start anew.

            "<|startoftext|>This game is one of my all time favourites. If it wasn't for my parents blocking me from buying it and their inability to pay for the DLC, I would have thought it was just another € type game. And as if that weren't already, their previous version was the one which resulted in my son becoming a powerful ruler, forcing me to exile him. I also had to imprison my horse, after it refused to renounce its claims. You can play as a historical character like Richard the Great and a horse, or one of many other noble and dignitary. I myself was a horse, I am content. But there is simply no way I can deny that this is the best of the strategy games! So what are the big drawbacks of the game? Well the biggest is the price. I paid this game 4 times back in the day for 40 euros, once on sale and once in a very humid, cold climate. As I said, the game was not the best, but they had to make it so they could sell the dlc, so don't expect the same quality products from this developer. And what are the things you can't do in the game? Well you can't just go and raid other lords land and that kind of thing. Also the game has no trade routes, that is a big problem. Also the game doesn't let you hold any vassals hostage, you need a Casus Beli, which is much easier to obtain if you have good reason. The big problem with the game is their DLC policy. If you want to have any fun at all, you have to make purchases from a certain game, this will result in many interesting options. The most interesting and best DLCs are not in the game, they are in the workshop, that's why. It will result in a Game Of Thrones, and other like CKII but in a different universe.<|endoftext|>\n",

I have played the Game of Thrones mod and it is amazing.  It is a great game to play with your friends.     You can make your own character, or you can import one from the Game of Thrones mod.  If you are into strategy games and want more detail then this is the game for you.  It has a large learning curve but is rewarding to learn.   There are many ways to play and many different types of rulers.  It is a sandbox type game.  I have played a few games where you should just build up troops, build up economy, and build up tech.    In Crusader Kings 2, you play more of a marriage game.  You play mostly at the political level and make strategic marriages and strategic alliances.

You would need to pay for the DLCs themselves, and most of them are around 5 dollars each.  The problem is that most of the DLCs are just cosmetic, such as portraits or songs.  You don't need them, and they don't add to the game experience.  If you can get them for $5 apiece, that's fine.  But most of the DLCs add significantly to the game experience, and you don't need them.\n",

I could see myself putting 200 bucks into the DLCs to play as a Muslim or a Pagan ruler, and having the whole time my character not do one little thing that would make the developers think I did something wrong.  I could also see myself spending another 200 bucks to be able to have full freedom to play as a merchant prince, and not be subject to any particular laws.\n",
