That's really the only thing missing from this game right now, and I mean that in a lot of ways. You essentially have a single player campaign for this game (Moheli at least has a winning formula, and it looks like some pretty impressive Vulkan patches will do just that), and a monthly cycle of casual to grand prix tickets. And the answer is pretty damn good.\n",

I'll say it: not that that's wrong or anything... just that....\"awesome\" game design is important.  Wrap your hands around every other game and have a go at it.  Wrap your forearms around every other card game and have a go at it too.\n",

            "The story is compelling, engaging, and very moving.  The three factions in this game are fairly straightforward to relate to: the average player consists of a single devoted fan, who interact via social media to draw or measure interest. The fan draws the card, and the equation is simple: they want a specific number of like-minded people to spend an average of every other card game they've played. The game follows a basic 5-5 linear progression, with 10-12 victories for every 10-14 victories for every similar collection. Eventually, the player with the most wins, and the most wins+consumers reaches the player with the most wins+consumers' most recent loss (a tiebreaking decision). You're left with a fairly straightforward set of three outcomes: you lose every time, or the game is fair.\n",

            " Magic's ability to find ways to syphon money from people who aren't really interested in the game.  There's a lack of replay, and it gets worse each day.  The more cards are out on the market, the scarier it is to get cards you didn't need because you didn't pay for them in o0n24''. Thankfully Valve has taken a page from their playbook and is moving forward with a game that is free to play. If you're still reading this, know that this is a free to play game.  The only way to get more cards is via player pay, and the prices are pretty awful.  You start out with 20 card packs and 5 tickets.  That means you basically get nothing for playing this game for 5 hours. When you hit this point, you're probably going to get a few bad trades or poor decisions (in paper format) that will likely damage your business.  If you're still reading this, know that this is actually a pretty good game overall. And it's not just cards that are cheap. You can get rare cards too.  Can't say that is good for efficiency, but can be good for being able to get more cards.\n",
            "Read full review here.\n",
            " 4.  The pricing policy encourages you to buy packs before paying. This, by itself, is bad but it is not huge enough to prevent me from recommending this game to people. Pay for the game and you are left with 5+ packs for free. Then pay for the consumable item after that, even if that item is worth nothing. The number one reason to not recommend this game is that you can get cards for free with the market. You can get rare cards for free with the market, but you will be refunded if you spend another card in excess of what you paid for in game.\n",
            "Easy to play but tedious to master. The only way to get more cards is.. you guessed it right? It's true that you will be refunded if you do not spend more cards in your current game. This is because the game mode in is full of problems. You will be prompted to start a game with certain cards. You can start a new game without beginning a new game. You will also probably get a message saying that you cannot start a game with the cards you already have. This is because the game mode in which you start a new game is called the \"art mode\". You can't create a new deck with the same names as your friend, you have to find a way to play the deck you drew as well. So you will never win a reward because you won't be able to add your own spells. When you are done playing the game, you can't play another card from your hand because you have to return to the game a second time because the deck you drew as well is no longer playable. This really is the crux of the problem with the game mode in which you start a game. You can't create a new deck with the same names as your friend. You have to find a way to play the deck you drew as well. You can create decks from other cards, but you need to use other means of getting cards. Like I said, it's true that you will never win a reward because you won't be able to add decks to play with. But how do you get decks? Well, you can't find them if you aren't using a strategy that gives you the win. Like I said, it's really disappointing and I hope Valve can do something to revive this game. But once again, I'm the only one who is confused.\n",
            "This game is good.\n",
            "After all the hard work, is it really possible for a good player to win 100% of the time and still maintain a high standard of play?  The answer is yes.  It's all about skill, and perfectionism is an added skill in this game.  The occasional bad play can ruin the ride.  It's not even worth buying the game if you don't want to sink more money into it than some very lucky people.\n",
            "Also, do not buy the game unless you really want to learn the basics.  Theory: Learning the basic mechanics is straightforward, but new players are attracted to complexity too much to bear.  Theory: The most fun I had was in \"the derivative\" games, where the cards are the same on every screen.  The main card is the price of play, and the resources of the opponent are the same on every screen.  That's not fair.  Is it too restrictive or too random?  How do you make an open market for cards work?  We decide.\n",
            "I can learn the basic mechanics in the game, but it takes forever. Also, the tutorial is way too long.  How do you learn a new mechanic?  Read the manual.  Do not try to learn the basic mechanics in the game.  It is absolutely not possible to learn all the\n",

Once a card is available, it can be used in any order, so you have 90% chance to obtain a new card when you need it the most. This takes away from a lot of the planning in the game, but does make the process a lot more process based than some might think. I have never written a review for Artifact, but I will try not to think about it too much, but it does shake the game up a bit when someone else does.\n",
            "Artifact is a good game for a certain kind of player, I'm on the fence on whether or not I'm that kind of player. I'm enjoying Casual Phantom Draft for now but each time I run through a draft, I just find myself not wanting to touch the game for a few days.\n",

            "Unlike Hearthstone, I also didn't ever feel the urge to play \"just one more game\". This is mostly due to the fact that it is a much more complex game, and therefore each game is on average more taxxing to play than its more casual competitors. As great as it feels pulling off some creative tactics that bamboozle your opponents, it feels equally as crummy when it happens against you. This is mostly due to the amount of things to keep track of, and unless you have the patience to think through every possible outcome, you'll probably not have a great time.\n",
            "Here's a timeline of my experiences with the game:\n",

            "2. Decided to play a bunch of the premade deck events instead. (over the holidays)\n",

            "But WOW is this game boring. Like, unbelievably, mind-numbingly boring. Matches take a very long time for a CCG, and the action just isn't all that great. Perhaps it gets better at higher level play, but it just wasn't worth my time sticking around to find out. The starter decks feel so weak and lack synergy, so new players are welcomed to this overwrought game by stacks of cards that just feel so lame.\n",
            "GIven the alternatives on the market, in its current state, there is no way in hell I would recommend Artifact to a friend. Maybe to an enemy.\n",
            "Total garbage. At least I got my money back selling the cards which is nearly impossible now, since 99% of cards are worthless and you don't get 10 packs for buying the game anymore, only 5. (I know, I know, you can get packs by playing. But keep in mind this game had 60k people at launch and now it has 500). For all of you saying the game is not pay2win and it's cheaper to build a deck than Hearthstone, you're just fanboys.... I've been playing Hearthstone for a year now and I have several competitive decks, and I only bought the welcome pack, which is the cheapest. The only thing Artifact does better than Hearthstone (and basically every other card game) is that all cards you get are marketable and tradable. It's an interesting game, but Valve is greedy af. This should be free2play. Don't buy it, you will regret it.\n",
            "It's hard for me to openly and honestly recommend Artiact as it currently stands. The draft mode is probably the most compelling aspect of it, but every time I boot up the game and play a few games I end my session feeling exhausted. Not in the \"Ah that was a satisfying battle of wits way\" but more of a \"There's just a lot of information on screen\" kind of way.\n",

            "Card games do not have perfectly balanced cards, it's the nature of the beast and what ends up making draft formats funs. But Artifact is different in that it has Heroes. Unlike \"bombs\" you draft in, say, Magic: The Gathering, heroes are core to your strategy in the game, and keep coming back the entire game. They sway battles just by existing, sometimes in other lanes. The difference in a good hero and a bad one is GIGANTIC, to the point where having one or two key heroes in your draft can seriously carry you hard.\n",
            "Randomness is also huge in Artifact. It's built into the core game. Due to how position on units works, you have a 25% chance to attack a target to your left\n",

            "Cons:\n",
            "There is zero way to gain cards other than pay out of your pocket. Every other card game has a ingame currency where you can grind to progress but not here. I am already bored of this game as there's no method of progression.\n",
            "The game didn't accept my refund because of i open a box during the start of the game(force to open so that u can't get a refund)  The game is too hard to play only for 5 hours which was waste of my time and i highly recommend that you shouldn't buy this game\n",
            "keep getting bong by those rich kids. and no way to earn new card without adding more money . game play is really nc but how i gonna play card game with just trush cards\n",
            "The game itself doesn't look bad. In the beginning you will have tons of fun, building decks, opening your first 10 packs and luckily acquiring Axe as rare hero, just like I did.\n",
            "After that, I was playing around in the social plays and I was really enjoying the game.\n",
            "But later, it gets boring and boring. The cards that matter are so expensive! You will get stuck in a way that you can not expand your library if you don't spend some money in the market or by buying some packs.\n",
            "If you like being competitive (like I do), you have 5 tickets on the beginning and that's it... you need to satisfy yourself with the casual play or buy some tickets with real money.\n",
            "For those who have played MTG Arena you will understand my point here. MTG has a system that you can play for free. Are you going to take a long time until you build your deck? The answer is yes! But at least you have the feeling that you're moving forward with the deck you wanna build.\n",

            "The pay-to-play-aspect didn't bother me too much in draft. Usually I make enough packs to recycle cards/sell cards for tickets and be playing endlessly, more or less. The inital price is justified thinking about how much time I could genuinely spend on the game.\n",
            "Drafting was a lot of fun for a while, but now that I have explored the process, the novelty fades.\n",
            "The endless RNG is becoming frustrating.\n",
            "Slowly farming booster packs isn't incentive enough to cover this up for me.\n",
            "Getting 3 very bad drafts in a row, losing a highly favored game to cheating death and I must say: I've had it for now.\n",
            "Haven't gotten behind the paywall for constructed yet, but watching streamers I get the impression that this mode has some serious issues. I won't spend the extra money just to try it.\n",

Don't get me wrong, you probably heard lots of good stuff about this game. Valve made sure to organize a closed invite only closed beta closed tournament with all the good card professional players you all love, they surely loved this game too and weren't there only for the money. Ahm.\n",
            "Of course, you heard all the good stuff about Artifag from them and how they are happily still playing and streaming this best card game ever made, and also talking about it non-stop to their friends and their friends' mothers (and their mothers' friends' friends). You should follow them too and do it exactly as well (that is: continue playing Heartsone/Gwent/thatothergameyoulove, you don't have to think about it too much, you will do well sabotaging the competition). Valve carefully listened well to all their honest positive feedback, such game consisting of masterfully perfected core mechanics barely changed throughout the whole beta period. Even the official post-beta release is still lacking basic game functionality like chat, replays, any leaderboards or any rank system or any game history/statistics at all...\n",

            "The game itself plays perfectly fine, if not a little on the way too slow side. It's a fine enough Magic style tabletop game with the added functions only a digital environment could achieve. It's fun at times, but not something I can really sit myself down for often enough.\n",
            "But I just cannot get behind the games monetization. One of the advantages of making a digital ccg over a physical one is that you can get rid of all the problems the distribution of physical card games have, like replacing paying for individual cards with things like Hearthstone's dusting system (which is admittedly on the stingy side when it comes to actually dusting cards but I digress).\n",
            "Not only does this game not try to break free of traditional methods of card distribution, it actively encourages it with how easy it is to just put cards onto the community market. The game is also twenty goddamn dollars at base, with the justification being they give you packs (which they just recently cut down to 5 from 10 btw), some event tickets (which are also for sale and your only way to enter the competitive ladder and drafts) and two semi-playable decks. But even games like Magic make and give away free decks to dip your toes into the game and figure the basics, and Hearthstone has the decency of things like Brawls and quests to earn more packs.\n",

            "[h1][b]2. EVENT TICKETS [/b][/h1]- now this one is a joke. Basically, if you want to play ranked (called \"expert\" in Artifact and earn packs) you need an event ticket that, guess what.... Can only be BOUGHT for like a $1 (or you can farm these tickets if you have high win-rate ratio in ranked), so basically you either need to be REALLY GOOD at the game to continue playing ranked or just spent bucks TO PLAY RANKED. Bear in mind, you've already bought the game for 20$.\n",

            "As much as I like Artifact, i dont recommend it for two reasons.First of all, the cards are so cheap. You can get 5 packs for just 1 ticket. I am sure many card players will say the same about deckbuilding games. Why? Because of the prices. You need 5 cards for the game, 2 more for a tp screen, 1 more for a screenshot, and 1 more for a dota screen. Get 'em while they also charge scratch $39 for those, and a couple of packs to get going.Oh wait, I was just thinking about how much fun that would be. Ahm.\n",
            "You need around 10 minutes (depending on how long I play) to practice with the cards, before the match starts. You can play for 15 minutes, before the match finishes.\n",
            "There is no practice mode, you need to win 5 before you lose 2.\n",
            "There is no community challenge, you need to win 5 before you lose 2.\n",

            "There is no ranked mode, you need to win 5 before you lose 2.\n",
            "Oh man i've played TCGs before but this s**t is insane. The RNG is off the charts where one random effect can ruin 30 minutes of carefull planning. Now i know games like this rely on RNG to draw cards but the abilities themselves are a hellhole. The only good thing is the limited time mode that's on right now but I have a feeling its not gonna last. Word of advice if you do buy it, sell all your rare and uncommon cards cause this game unlike DotA wont last long.\n",
            "The monetisation of Artifact has been done to death, ultimately people will decide if they want to put money into what I would say is a relatively cheap card game compared to others on the market, so instead I'm just going to discuss the gameplay.\n",
            "First up, the gameplay itself is very engaging. It's undeniable that matches are incredibly intense and absorbing experiences. There're plenty of things to keep track of without being too overwhelming, and the cards are fun to play around with even if there's a lack of fancy visual effects to everything. One of Artifact's least touted, but I believe best, features is that you're very rarely out of a match until you lose your last few structure points. I've eked out wins from opening positions that went disasterously and I've had victory snatched away from me in situations where I'd been ahead all game. That kind of balance in a card game, particularly in Artifact which has relatively few board clear effects, is pretty impressive.\n",
            "On a bad note about the gameplay, the learning curve to the strategy is somewhat fiddly. You make a lot of decisions in Artifact that, unfortunately, you never really get to find out if they were good or not. For instance, if you choose to abandon a lane then you'll never really know how it impacted the game outcome, even after the match finishes, because games generally run close anyway. You could argue that this just means that figuring out the strategic nuances in the game will take longer and so players will remain invested in playing, but it's sort of frustrating when you're trying to learn, and I suspect it's the kind of thing you only really have an understanding of after a considerable number of hours.\n",
            "However, engaging gameplay aside, Artifact does have one big problem at the moment and that's that there's not actually anything meaningful to do in it yet. There's no progression. If you play at the moment then you're just playing for the thrill of the matches themselves. The only meaningful progression available is the Expert Phantom Draft, which rewards card packs. If you're good then you can technically grind up a collection this way while still playing and enjoying the game. You could also get packs from Expert Constructed wins to expand your collection, however to play Constructed in the first place then you've probably paid to get a fair bit of the game collection already anyway. But that's it. There's no ladder, no visible ranked matchmaking (the casual matchmaking will put you against someone at your MMR, but it's not a visible number), no achievements, no campaign adventure, nothing.\n",
            "It's understandable that the game's essentially in early days and the game itself works beautifully, but there's just not a lot to do at the moment that earns you any kind of progression. Arguably, playing the game itself and getting more skillful at it is meaningful progression, but, let's face it, the gamers of today (myself included) want something visible to show for their time. Even an account level experience bar like in Dota\n",

            "7. Many thanks to everyone who played, and gave feedback, about 5 months after launch.\n",
            "As always, we appreciate your patience and understanding.\n",
            "As always, the developers of this game have released 4 under the last 2 weeks.\n",
            "The game was very close in nature, with all the good cards being perfectly fine. There are some cards that got lost in the shuffle, and even magic ones that need to be changed. As great as it feels pulling off some creative creative things, there are some very deep flaws in the overall design.\n",
            "I'm not sure how they plan to make the game run on mobile - I hope they add it as a free to play game.\n",
            "I think the game is fun for a few reasons.\n",
            "The cards are good, the gameplay interesting, the characters are great, replayability is high.\n",
            "The current player count is 50 people, with 10 more before we have a chance to fully enjoy the game.\n",
            "I think the game is fun for a few reasons.\n",
            "The cards are good, the gameplay interesting, the gameplay is really good, and the price is justified.\n",
            "The game costabillities make the game almost impossible to acquire.\n",
            "Other than that one \"free\" game, there is no other way to obtain cards than as a free update. And as a free update, you get a chance to play with some really good cards. Unique cards are also well crafted and look fantastic, making them particularly compelling with regard to gameplay.\n",
            "Playing the game is fun, but involved for a while. Then they came up with the concept of the game, and it's really all about skill and coordination. You need to be prepared as to which cards you're going to get after youload a bit, and which are going to get you where you are going wrong.\n",
            "Having said all that, the game is a very fun game, and I think it has a lot of potential. With practice and practice ends well, the game is all about skill and initiative.\n",
            "Playing the game is very straightforward, and I can say that is indeed the case. There are plenty of things to keep track of without being too overwhelming, and the cards are fun to play around with even if there's a lack of fancy visual effects to everything.\n",
            "The game takes a lot of strategy to play well, and while I appreciate the efforts, they just don't work well together.\n",
            "The two biggest pains points for me: Imbalance and Randomness.\n",
            "Card games do not have perfectly balanced cards, it's the nature of the beast and what ends up making draft formats funs. But Hearthstone has a much more balanced look to it, with a more balanced look at what goes into making and distributing cards.\n",
            "Randomness is also huge in Artifact, it's undeniable that there are going to be things that are too random for your average player to keep up with, and that is one of the biggest reasons I don't recommend it. Especially when its competitors provide some pretty awesome random effects, like Gaussian blur, which is awesome and surprising given the sheer amount of randomness in nature, but doesn't seem to bring anything close to its potential.\n",
            "Artifact is a good game for a certain kind of player, I'm on the fence on whether or not I'm that kind of player. I'm enjoying Casual Phantom Draft for now but each time I run through a draft, I just find myself not wanting to touch the game for a few days.\n",
            "Artifact might be for you, but it's certainly not for everyone.\n",
            "The worst buy I made last year, for sure.\n",
            "Not only is the game devoid of any progression or anything to earn you cards (at least at launch, it seems they added it now, too little too late for me though), but it\n",
