<|startoftext|>On top of having to pay for the game, the game is pay to win....
And once you open your first pack of cards you can't refund it but you can't play the game without opening the pack of cards. This game sucks...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Don't listen to anyone about this game. Valve planned like they do with all their games to constantly update it. If they released this as "early access" instead of officially releasing it, no one would've known the difference.
Fun game with amazing potential but it's cooler for nerds to hate on it because it's not X.
Excited for the long haul!
P.S. It is also one of  the cheapest computer card game but math is hard.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>even though the game isnt that good, i cant bring myself to dislike this game,
i bought this game for around $20 and get over $40 from selling the cards and i still got alot of tickets to play
now the game is literally dead and i still havent used these tickets<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I find this game quite intriguing, and enjoy playing both against the bot and against global opponents.  I have never had to wait more than about 10-20 seconds to find someone to play against.  I am not a particularly skilled player, but  I have a complete set of cards and enjoy trying different decks out to see the result.    Acquiring a complete set is not a big outlay at the moment, I would recommend buying them all individually and experimenting with different deck configurations.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>THIS GAME IS SHIT !!!!!
YOU BUY AN AMOUNT OF EXPENSIVE CARDS TO TRY TO MAKE A BIT OF STRATEGY IN UR DECK ...
BUT IS IMPOSSIBLE !!!
ONLY LUCK ,LUCK , AND AGAIN LUCK DECIDES IF YOU WIN A GAME OR NOT ..
YOU HAVE 0,0 INFLUENCE ON THE GAME 0 !!!!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Unfortunately there is no way to gain packs or progress in the game. The plus side is that I like its complexity. I still hope Valve will evolve and do something better with it, perhaps a total make-over with better ways to explore the game like Gwent.
Do not be like Might and Magic Duels, they had a great campaign and unbalanced pvp, and minimum ways to get/build great decks. In the end, it went to dust. In the other hand, Hearthstone has minimum pve content but has more than one way to create your deck of your liking. Although, I hate Hearthstone... because too simple to play and too much rng.
And last, MtG Arena is my favourite game! Valve must learn from WotC and not from Blizzard, so do not try to mimic their Activision-Blizzard's moves as they have the budget to sustain boldness. Hope this is heard and I hope things will get better for Artifact!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The best card game. You dont need to spend hours trying to grind cards, just buy them and devote your time to strategy. The gameplay is much deeper than in HS. Ihope devs will make major update worth to continue to play.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This game has the fairest monetization of any card game by an extremely wide margin. Owning all the cards in the game costs $52.87. Giving this a positive review to counter all arguments of an unfair business model.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Needed to make the game play faster.  The amount of boredom waiting for someone else to make 1 of 2 decisions over 8 minutes forced me to stop playing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I think they should make make priest 2 sequel..because the movie left u wanting more..there was not enough action.needs a little more wow factor.even though it had it in this one..weapons were cool.but,need to have more secret ones unvailed while fighting in 3D coming at us & the vampires needs to be hybrids in the next sequel some how with super strength,but,with a weak spot..that he tries to find in a ancient scroll or something unveiling passage ways with a mole the church that new about it the scroll after the fact..priest should be confronting the queen some how and stop her..movie should be a little bit longer too..he should have have 3 other priest to help him in his quest for victory to save the church & his people...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This was my first time buying Valve's game and being second Valve game that I have ever played (other being CS).
When I came out I loved the game, although it had some serious issues - balancing, progression and serious paywall  - I still liked it. (Wasn't able to play it that much because personal stuff, but was going to pick it up after some time, last time I gon it I got my ass handled to me couple of times by way better players).
I wanted it to be a successful game with constant updates, support and Devs talking to us.
You would imagine that Steam would be able to hire more people to work not only in the Artifact team, but overall. But yeah, when you monopolize something at some point you stop caring for other's opinion.
Two months of silence and you come out with this "significant amount of time" and then again silence .... Amazing.
Listen to your community, listen to other card communities what made them successful, do surveys, polls etc. Do something so that we know you are there. Say something, but no, there's just silence. Words in the wind.
P.S. I feel cheated.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I will probably get a whole bunch of hate messages for that, but i don't care so i just gonna say it: THIS GAME IS ACTUALLY FUN.
Praise The Sun as always, Leg4cy out<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The very beginning of Artifact was amazing. There weren't prebuilt decks pros recommended, and you could make your own decisions with your own strategies. Now the meta is all figured out, and you just buy the deck that gets you the win. I'm a casual card player, and I hate that aspect.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's actually such a good game, cannot understand why people aren't playing this, best card game out there atm. Please somebody come on so i can play against more than one person<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Was a good Idea and was fun to play. Then I noticed you gotta pay to play each time you want new cards. Yes there couple packs you can get for free but that´s more to keep you playing for a short period of time.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm mixed on this game.  Simply put, this game is a lot of fun.  It's very unique with its gameplay, but for me personally, I never had any intention of playing anything aside of vs bots.  I don't really have any competitive urge anymore.  The issue I have is that vs AI has --NO-- experience gain.  That means no free card packs for playing.  It really takes away from the sense of accomplishment and building up when you have to go to the marketplace and choose what cards you want.
I can't wait for the revamp to the game.  Gameplay is really solid and doesn't need any change, it's the microtransactions and lack of experience in single player.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Once a man said: “All's well, that's not Hearthstone”
That man was Albert Einstein
The soundtrack and gameplay are awesome, the game makes additions to Dota lore and develops it. No idea, why players don't like it...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Aesthetically, it's the most beautiful card game you will ever see. The art is great, the animations are fantastic.
The base mechanics are decent.
However, after those, the game falls apart.
Wait for the remake. They have no choice.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I come from a Prismata, Hearthstone, Eternal and MTGA background and really loved this game the most. But Valve obviously drop the ball on this one and I don't believe they'll be able to sustain the continuous need of a successful CCG with their no management infrastructure and no communication. I hope to proven wrong.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Really like that game. The gameplay is awesome, each match is a little bit long but the way you need to think to win it - awesome. Hope valve will fix f2w problem, but you can still win usual games without any donations.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Brothers and sisters, The Update is coming. With every passing day my visions grow stronger: An open beta. A better F2P grind. And a PR team that whispers 'Prepare for better advertising.' Prepare. Such a simple word that does no justice to the Long Haul that lies before us... We must be heralds; walking testimonies to the brilliance of The Game. Spreading the word of The Update's glorious arrival, no matter if that message is received with joy or scorn. We must be architects; building not just another balance change for those who believe what I have seen, but an entire rework that is worthy of The Update's splendor. We must be zealots; willing to lay down our wallets in defense of this sacred game, because rest assured we are at war. Hearthstone and its deceptive cash grab business model will stop at nothing to undo the work that we've accomplished, and that is why we must return in kind. -GabeN, Priest of the Volvo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Deep down, there is a good game here. It's deeply strategic and games always feel like real nail-biters. But there is also some very deep flaws to the overall gameplay. These flaws unfortunately overwhelm the positive aspects of the game. In theory a game of cards based on Dota Lore should be a slam dunk, but this feels like a major air ball. I'm hoping Valve can do something to revive this game. I honestly don't know what they can do other than a complete overhaul of the core gameplay mechanics.<|endoftext|>
